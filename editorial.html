                            <h4 style="color: blue;">Spirit of Eid-ul-Fitr</h4>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Eid-ul-Fitr is only one or two days away. For the whole month of Ramadan the Muslim faithful have observed one of the five pillars of Islam, devoting themselves to fasting, prayer and charity while performing essential daily chores. During the month of Ramadan Muslims all over the world avoid earthly pleasures and look steadfastly towards Allah seeking the good and well-being of humanity. Eid-ul-Fitr is a day of thanksgiving with the profoundest gratitude to Almighty Allah after the worship and supplications in the most blessed month of Ramadan. The strength of a society can be determined by what Ibn Khaldun described as a group feeling and concern of the members for one another. Individuals in the society share the joys and sorrows of each other directly or indirectly and they are held together by institutions and ceremonies. The Eid reminds us of the equality of man. It teaches us that Muslims are brothers-rich or poor. It is a festival that reflects this spirit of fraternity. The affluent express their concern for the poor through charity called Fitra. This is the most important element of their celebration for which the whole festivity is known as Eid-ul-Fitr or festivity of charity. The Eid is not merely a day of feasting. It is the day of spiritual regeneration for Muslims. The entire Muslim world, on this happy occasion, beams with joy and pleasure. But a serious question crops up: Are the Muslims celebrating the occasion as a mere ritual or are they doing it in its real spirit? In the present day context, Muslims everywhere must exercise the introspection and ponder seriously if they have been able to forget the ill-will of the past days, enmity towards their enemies and rivals or if they have done something to help eliminate disparity in the society. Islam is complete submission to Allah's will and a true Muslim always has to abide by the commandments of Allah. What value is fasting devoid of sober reflections after Ramadan is over? This question should form the basis for greater introspection in running the business of everyday living of all right-thinking Muslims. A cheerful giver during Ramadan should always remain a genial altruist afterwards being protective and kind to the downtrodden if the society must advance beyond the present rancour, acrimony, violence, corruption and other vices that characterize human existence. This Eid-ul-Fitr has again provided us with another occasion for soul-searching. The Muslims must ask themselves if they are following the true path of Islam, the faith of peace and tolerance.

The bank has hired around 30 women through the program since 2016, it said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc started its Trader Academy in London last year, offering eight months of mentoring, networking and job shadowing for 16 female college students. The bank plans to expand the program to the Americas this year and Asia soon after. Goldman has said it wants women to eventually make up half of its overall workforce, but acknowledges trading is far from that goal. “Having women in particular from a trading perspective has always been a challenge for us,” said Janine Glasenberg, the bank’s head of graduate recruiting in Europe, the Middle East text of the printing and typesetting industry.Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">TWO lobbies were clearly worried by a photograph that was clicked during the swearing-in celebrations of the Karnataka anti-BJP coalition. It showed Congress leader Sonia Gandhi locked in a rare embrace with Dalit leader Mayawati. The picture had other leaders who were opposed to the Modi-led BJP government basking in the glory of the Karnataka victory, but the hugging of the two women was a defining moment. Insidious advisers to the Congress leadership had stalled their coming together in the past. Among the understated reasons was the stark reality that some of the Gandhi family’s upper-caste advisers also happened to be conduits for the mercantile lobbies based in Mumbai. The photograph threatened both, the tycoons and their caste protégés adorning the upper houses of legislatures, where those who cannot win the Lok Sabha or assembly polls are given a cosy perch, not just in Congress. There is a brouhaha about former president and former Congress minister Pranab Mukherjee’s visit to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh headquarters.</p></div><br/>

                            <p style="text-align: left;"><b>By Yousuf Mahbubul Islam, PhD</b></p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Have we made preparations to face God on the Day of Judgment? In other words, have we planned our answers to the questions that God may ask on the Final Day before eternal life? In a fast moving world, the words used, i.e., facing God, Day of Judgment, Final Day and eternal life may seem distant, odd or unrelated – should they be? The fact of the matter is that we are living an intelligent life that we ourselves did not create – we are living a personality that we personally did not design. The fact that we love ourselves or love who we are, is a proof that we derive pleasure from the existence that we have been given. Would it be appropriate to give a thought to Who gave us this wonderful existence? Let us look at something that Prophet David (pbuh) said to God, as quoted in the Bible. “For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.” [Psalms 139:13 – 14] {1} In addition, we live in an environment that we did not create. So, can we run away from the fact that we are enjoying a complete existence that we had no hand in creating? In the Verses from the Psalms, what is Prophet David acknowledging? He is witnessing the fact of his creation, the fact that he has been beautifully made in a protected womb stage by stage and thus praising God, the Creator. Feel the underlying tone of the Verse. Is it full of adoration for God? Is it appropriate to observe and witness what God has done, praise and adore Him? Notice that it is only a human being who can question what he/she observes and thereby act as a witness to the truth of God’s awe inspiring creation. In the Al-Qur’an God confirms the reason for creating human beings, “It is He Who brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers when you knew nothing; and He gave you hearing and sight and intelligence and affections: that you may give thanks (to God).” [16.78] Humans first have to question what they hear and see and work out the truth of the one and only Creator.  </p>
