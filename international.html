                            <p style="text-align: justify;">THE OVAL, Jun 14: They were handing out sandpaper boundary placards on the
                                way up from Vauxhall Tube Station, but in the end, nothing could smooth away the rough edges in 
                                Australia’s new-look batting line-up. Despite their rookie bowling attack mounting a spirited defence
                                of a substandard target of 215, England overcame a double dose of jitters to seal a three-wicket
                                victory in the first ODI at The Kia Oval, reports Cricinfo. Most of the pre-series focus had, rightly,
                                been on the absence of Australia’s finest two batsmen, David Warner and Steven Smith, and, as might
                                have been expected, they struggled to mitigate for that void in class. After winning the toss on a
                                bright afternoon in South London, Australia mustered 214 in 47 overs, the sort of slow-death innings
                                that exposed their shortcomings more comprehensively than a full-on batting collapse could have done
                                . Nevertheless, England aren’t without a few notable embarrassments in their (very) recent history,
                                and only days after failing to close out a chase of 372 to hand Scotland a famous victory, they came
                                improbably close to stumbling in pursuit of a target of barely half that height. The beanpole seamer
                                Billy Stanlake was the catalyst for Australia’s defiance, bowling Jason Roy second-ball for a duck as 
                                England slipped to 38 for 3 at the top of their innings, before Andrew Tye and his illegible T20
                                variations came to the fore in the tense closing stages. In the end it was left to David Willey to
                                haul England over the line with an improbably grindy knock of 35 from 41 balls, with Liam Plunkett
                                unbowed for the second match running on 3. But even then, England still won with a handsome 36 
                                deliveries to spare, which spoke to the gulf in batting quality more eloquently than the official
                                margin of victory. That was largely a testament to the elder-statesman class of Joe Root and Eoin
                                Morgan. Their fourth-wicket stand of 115 in 21 overs managed to combine defensive accumulation with
                                calculated aggression in a manner that Australia’s own middle order had been unable to replicate. 
                                Without such knowhow to rescue their innings, England really would have been in the soup. But then
                                again, that is the entire point of experience. Before the start of play, Tim Paine had seemed 
                                visibly excited at the prospect of ending all the talk of sledging and cheating, and getting back to 
                                the day job. But, by the innings break, the captain who had instigated a pre-match handshake with 
                                his opponents to mark the start of a new era for his team might have been wondering if he was really
                                that keen to starting talking about actual cricket once again. The early exchanges of Australia’s 
                                innings amounted to a vivisection of the tourists’ anxieties in overseas conditions. Willey’s
                                prodigious new-ball swing accounted for Travis Head via a flat-footed slash to slip from his 
                                second delivery, before Moeen Ali came whirling through the middle overs, putting his miserable 
                                winter behind him with single-spell figures of 10-1-43-3 that might have been lifted straight out of 
                                the 1997 Texaco Trophy. Four balls into Moeen’s spell, Aaron Finch gave himself room outside off to 
                                pick out short third man with an ambitious wipe. Two balls into his second over, Shaun Marsh stayed 
                                leg-side of a well-flighted tweaker, a la Ben Duckett in Bangladesh, and lost his off stump for 24.
                                And when Paine himself, desperate to set a tempo, any tempo, offered catching practice to short third
                                man with a muffed reverse sweep, Moeen’s figures were 3 for 11 in 4.1 overs. After that, it was a 
                                given that he’d bowl his spell straight through. Adil Rashid kept him company for a six-over burst
                                of his own, in which time he scalped Marcus Stoinis for 22, before Glenn Maxwell rode to the rescue 
                                of his team’s dignity, if not the overall match situation. A restorative 84-run stand for the sixth
                                wicket ended when Plunkett induced a top-edged a pull to deep square leg, and when Ashton Agar misread
                                the length of a Rashid legbreak to be plumb lbw for 40, the tail were rounded up meekly. But there was
                                nothing meek about the response of Stanlake in particular. In the absence of Mitchell Starc, Pat C
                                ummins and Josh Hazlewood, this was his chance to demonstrate the timeless virtues of hitting a good 
                                length at 90mph. Roy survived one ball before losing the top of his off stump to a beautiful nipbacker,
                                and when the debutant Michael Neser made it two wicket-maidens in the space of four overs by pinning 
                                Alex Hales on leg stump, the game was officially afoot. Jonny Bairstow, with three ODI hundreds in as 
                                many innings, once again looked a different class in easing to 28 from 22 balls with six outstanding 
                                boundaries. But then he nailed a pull straight into the hands of the lone man at square leg to give 
                                Kane Richardson his breakthrough, and England faced a test of their ego at 38 for 3. But Root and 
                                Morgan swallowed their pride and ate up the overs with deft sweeps, well-placed drives and sharp 
                                judgement of the quick singles. By the 29th over, they were 153 for 3 and cruising; three overs later,
                                they’d lost both of their set batsman plus the dangerous Jos Buttler as well, who may be in some of the
                                best form of his life, but today read Tye’s knuckle ball as if it was a Jaipur railway timetable. He had
                                already been dropped off Stanlake - a swirling chance to Paine behind the stumps, who spilled it as his 
                                elbows hit the ground - when he scuffed a drive to mid-off. Moeen, determined to carry on playing his 
                                way despite criticism of his dismissal at the Grange, looked to have the chase in hand when he holed out
                                to deep midwicket to give Neser his second and ignite that debate all over again. But in the end, he’d 
                                already done enough with the ball to ensure that England’s wobbles would not be terminal. BRIEF

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">South Korean President Moon Jae-In said on Thursday the world had escaped the threat of war after this
                                week's Singapore summit, echoing US President Donald Trump's upbeat assessment of his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, 
                                reports Reuters. Trump and Kim issued a joint statement after their historic meeting that reaffirmed the North's commitment to "work
                                toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula", an end to joint US-South Korean military exercises and gave US guarantees
                                of security to North Korea. "There have been many analyses on the outcome of the summit but I think what's most important was that the
                                people of the world, including those in the United States, Japan and Koreans, have all been able to escape the threat of war, nuclear 
                                weapons and missiles," Moon told U. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ahead of a meeting between the two in Seoul. The summit statement
                                provided no details on when Pyongyang would give up its nuclear weapons programme or how the dismantling might be verified. Skeptics
                                of how much the meeting achieved pointed to the North Korean leadership's long-held view that nuclear weapons are a bulwark against
                                what it fears are US plans to overthrow it and unite the Korean peninsula. "I am confident that we took a very good, significant step
                                in Singapore," Pompeo told Moon on Thursday. Pompeo said a day earlier he would like to accomplish major nuclear disarmament in North 
                                Korea within Trump's current term. "Absolutely ... you used the term major, major disarmament, something like that? We're hopeful that
                                we can achieve that in the 2-1/2 years," he said. Trump returned to the United States on Wednesday and took to Twitter to hail the
                                meeting, the first between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, as a major win for American security. "Everybody can now
                                feel much safer than the day I took office," Trump tweeted. "There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea. Meeting with Kim
                                Jong Un was an interesting and very positive experience. North Korea has great potential for the future!" The United States has long
                                insisted on complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation by North Korea but, in the summit statement, North Korea committed 
                                only to the "complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula", phrasing it has used in the past. Pompeo, who is charged by Trump
                                
                                with leading follow-on negotiations, bristled at a question about why the words "verifiable" and "irreversible" were not used in the 
                                summit joint statement in the context of denuclearisation. "It's in the statement. You're just wrong about that ... Because complete 
                                encompasses verifiable and irreversible. I suppose you could argue semantics, but let me assure you that it's in the document," Pompeo
                                said on Wednesday. Democratic critics in the United States said the agreement was short on detail and the Republican president had 
                                made too many concessions to Kim, whose country is under UN sanctions for its nuclear and weapons programme and is widely condemned 
                                for human rights abuses. Pompeo and Moon will meet Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono in Seoul later on Thursday to discuss the
                                summit and next steps. Tokyo has reacted with concern at Trump's plans to cancel military exercises with South Korea, saying such
                                drills are vital for East Asian security. Two North Korean missiles flew over Japan last year as Pyongyang made rapid advances in
                                its programme to develop a missile capable of striking the US mainland with a nuclear warhead. Tokyo is working on arranging a 
                                meeting between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Kim Jong Un, with one possibility including the premier's visit to Pyongyang around 
                               
                                August, the Yomiuri newspaper reported. A government source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Japanese officials planned 
                                to discuss the summit meeting with North Korean officials at an international conference on Northeast Asian security to be held in 
                                Mongolia on Thursday and Friday. Despite Trump and Moon's assertions about the North Korean nuclear threat being over, a senior US 
                                official responsible for studying the North Korean military said the US intelligence assessment of the nuclear and other military 
                                threat posed by North Korea to US and allied forces in Asia and the northwest Pacific remained unchanged. US officials said it was
                                unclear what types of training involving US and South Korean troops might cross into Trump's now forbidden zone of "war games". But 
                                big, joint US-South Korean exercises appeared off-limits under the new guidance. "Make no mistake, we are going to maintain the 
                                readiness of our forces in South Korea," said one US official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official acknowledged, 
                                however, it was still not certain how that was going to happen. The United States maintains about 28,500 soldiers in South Korea,
                                which remains in a technical state of war with the North after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty. </p></div><br/>

                                making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
                                looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through 
                                the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from
                                sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
                                written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
                                first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                                The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 
                                1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact
