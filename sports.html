                            <img src="image/23.jpg" height="90px" width="70%" alt="news"/>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Portugal continued their preparations for the World Cup in unremarkable
                                fashion on Wednesday, painting a strikingly different picture to that of Spain, who on Friday will be 
                                their first opponents in the group stage, reports The Daily Mail. While Spain were busy replacing 
                                sacked head coach Julen Lopetegui with Fernando Hierro, the reigning European champions were going 
                                about their business without a hitch at their World Cup base in Ramensky, located just outside Moscow.
                                Cristiano Ronaldo and Bernardo Silva both looked in fine spirits as Fernando Santos took his players 
                                through a routine training session, serving to underline the storm their Group B rivals are currently 
                                having to endure. Indeed, the Manchester City midfielder admits Portugal would be in dire straights 
                                if their manager Santos decided to walk away now. He said simply: ‘It would be a problem for us if 
                                Santos left.’ Just how much the turmoil affects Spain will not become clear until the two Iberian 
                                nations clash at the Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi on Friday, but they can take plenty of heart
                                from their record in previous fixtures. Spain have dominated matches between the pair, winning 16 
                                of their 35 meetings with only six wins for Portugal. Four of those have been at major tournaments
                                with Spain winning the last two - at the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012. With Morocco and Iran making 
                                up the group, both teams could be forgiven for being happy with a draw when they clash on Friday but
                                Santos has other ideas. ‘I am not signing off on anything other than a win,’ he said. ‘We’ve come here 
                                to win every game that we play.’ Portugal have lost only once in 24 competitive matches since Santos 
                                took charge in September 2014 although they he has been criticised for a dour and pragmatic approach
                                to the game. Ronaldo, who can basically seal a sixth Ballon d’Or title by guiding Portugal to their 
                                second major tournament triumph in the space of two years, will be looking to change that. </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">THE OVAL, Jun 14: They were handing out sandpaper boundary placards on the
                                way up from Vauxhall Tube Station, but in the end, nothing could smooth away the rough edges in 
                                Australia’s new-look batting line-up. Despite their rookie bowling attack mounting a spirited defence
                                of a substandard target of 215, England overcame a double dose of jitters to seal a three-wicket
                                victory in the first ODI at The Kia Oval, reports Cricinfo. Most of the pre-series focus had, rightly,
                                been on the absence of Australia’s finest two batsmen, David Warner and Steven Smith, and, as might
                                have been expected, they struggled to mitigate for that void in class. After winning the toss on a
                                bright afternoon in South London, Australia mustered 214 in 47 overs, the sort of slow-death innings
                                that exposed their shortcomings more comprehensively than a full-on batting collapse could have done
                                . Nevertheless, England aren’t without a few notable embarrassments in their (very) recent history,
                                and only days after failing to close out a chase of 372 to hand Scotland a famous victory, they came
                                improbably close to stumbling in pursuit of a target of barely half that height. The beanpole seamer
                                Billy Stanlake was the catalyst for Australia’s defiance, bowling Jason Roy second-ball for a duck as 
                                England slipped to 38 for 3 at the top of their innings, before Andrew Tye and his illegible T20
                                variations came to the fore in the tense closing stages. In the end it was left to David Willey to
                                haul England over the line with an improbably grindy knock of 35 from 41 balls, with Liam Plunkett
                                unbowed for the second match running on 3. But even then, England still won with a handsome 36 
                                deliveries to spare, which spoke to the gulf in batting quality more eloquently than the official
                                margin of victory. That was largely a testament to the elder-statesman class of Joe Root and Eoin
                                Morgan. Their fourth-wicket stand of 115 in 21 overs managed to combine defensive accumulation with
                                calculated aggression in a manner that Australia’s own middle order had been unable to replicate. 
                                Without such knowhow to rescue their innings, England really would have been in the soup. But then
                                again, that is the entire point of experience. Before the start of play, Tim Paine had seemed 
                                visibly excited at the prospect of ending all the talk of sledging and cheating, and getting back to 
                                the day job. But, by the innings break, the captain who had instigated a pre-match handshake with 
                                his opponents to mark the start of a new era for his team might have been wondering if he was really
                                that keen to starting talking about actual cricket once again. The early exchanges of Australia’s 
                                innings amounted to a vivisection of the tourists’ anxieties in overseas conditions. Willey’s
                                prodigious new-ball swing accounted for Travis Head via a flat-footed slash to slip from his 
                                second delivery, before Moeen Ali came whirling through the middle overs, putting his miserable 
                                winter behind him with single-spell figures of 10-1-43-3 that might have been lifted straight out of 
                                the 1997 Texaco Trophy. Four balls into Moeen’s spell, Aaron Finch gave himself room outside off to 
                                pick out short third man with an ambitious wipe. Two balls into his second over, Shaun Marsh stayed 
                                leg-side of a well-flighted tweaker, a la Ben Duckett in Bangladesh, and lost his off stump for 24.
                                And when Paine himself, desperate to set a tempo, any tempo, offered catching practice to short third
                                man with a muffed reverse sweep, Moeen’s figures were 3 for 11 in 4.1 overs. After that, it was a 
                                given that he’d bowl his spell straight through. Adil Rashid kept him company for a six-over burst
                                of his own, in which time he scalped Marcus Stoinis for 22, before Glenn Maxwell rode to the rescue 
                                of his team’s dignity, if not the overall match situation. A restorative 84-run stand for the sixth
                                wicket ended when Plunkett induced a top-edged a pull to deep square leg, and when Ashton Agar misread
                                the length of a Rashid legbreak to be plumb lbw for 40, the tail were rounded up meekly. But there was
                                nothing meek about the response of Stanlake in particular. In the absence of Mitchell Starc, Pat C
                                ummins and Josh Hazlewood, this was his chance to demonstrate the timeless virtues of hitting a good 
                                length at 90mph. Roy survived one ball before losing the top of his off stump to a beautiful nipbacker,
                                and when the debutant Michael Neser made it two wicket-maidens in the space of four overs by pinning 
                                Alex Hales on leg stump, the game was officially afoot. Jonny Bairstow, with three ODI hundreds in as 
                                many innings, once again looked a different class in easing to 28 from 22 balls with six outstanding 
                                boundaries. But then he nailed a pull straight into the hands of the lone man at square leg to give 
                                Kane Richardson his breakthrough, and England faced a test of their ego at 38 for 3. But Root and 
                                Morgan swallowed their pride and ate up the overs with deft sweeps, well-placed drives and sharp 
                                judgement of the quick singles. By the 29th over, they were 153 for 3 and cruising; three overs later,
                                they’d lost both of their set batsman plus the dangerous Jos Buttler as well, who may be in some of the
                                best form of his life, but today read Tye’s knuckle ball as if it was a Jaipur railway timetable. He had
                                already been dropped off Stanlake - a swirling chance to Paine behind the stumps, who spilled it as his 
                                elbows hit the ground - when he scuffed a drive to mid-off. Moeen, determined to carry on playing his 
                                way despite criticism of his dismissal at the Grange, looked to have the chase in hand when he holed out
                                to deep midwicket to give Neser his second and ignite that debate all over again. But in the end, he’d 
                                already done enough with the ball to ensure that England’s wobbles would not be terminal. BRIEF 
                                SCORES: England 218 for 7 (Morgan 69, Root 50) beat Australia 214 (Maxwell 62, Plunkett 3-42 Moeen 3-43)

                            <h4 style="color: blue;">Will he or won’t he? Egypt holds its breath over injured Salah</h4>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">YEKATERINBURG, Russia, Jun 14: Mohamed Salah is in a high-profile race to be
                                fit for Egypt’s World Cup opener against Uruguay on Friday and even opponents are hoping the Liverpool 
                                ace could yet play a role in Russia, reports AFP. The striker and Egyptian superstar, who is nursing an 
                                injured shoulder, is crucial to the north African side’s hopes of making it out of a weak-looking Group
                                A also featuring the hosts and Saudi Arabia. Egypt play Uruguay — tipped by some to be dark horses — in
                                Yekaterinburg in just the second game of the tournament, following Russia against Saudi Arabia in the 
                                opening match. Salah, who turns 26 on the day of the game, gave 100 million frantic Egyptians a massive 
                                boost on Wednesday when he joined a squad training session at their Grozny base. He had been sidelined 
                                since suffering a shoulder injury in Liverpool’s Champions League final loss to Real Madrid on May 26, 
                                casting severe doubt on his World Cup participation. He went through a range of warm-up exercises with
                                his team-mates, but Egyptian team officials are giving little away. “There’s a good degree of progress but 
                                no definitive decision on whether he takes part, as we are following his case day by day,” team director
                                Ihab Lahita told reporters. Egypt’s 62-year-old Argentine coach Hector Cuper will conduct a pre-match press
                                conference on Thursday, but there are suggestions that he wants to see Salah train again before making any
                                decision on whether the player is fit to face a Uruguay side boasting the twin attacking threat of Luis 
                                Suarez and Edinson Cavani. The most likely outcome is that Salah, one of the outstanding players in the 
                                world this season as he helped propel Liverpool to the Champions League final, will be on the bench on 
                                Friday. Salah’s World Cup dream was left on the brink when he exited the final in tears after Real Madrid 
                                skipper Sergio Ramos wrestled him to the ground. Cuper has attempted to dismiss the notion that Egypt are a
                                one-man side, but with 44 goals in all competitions this season for Liverpool, Salah’s badly timed injury 
                                has become a national obsession back home. Salah is regarded as a contender for the Ballon d’Or for his 
                                spectacular debut season at Anfield, alongside Argentina’s Lionel Messi, Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo and 
                                Neymar of Brazil. The tournament in Russia will be the poorer for Salah missing out and Uruguay goalkeeper
                                Fernando Muslera has expressed hope that Salah will play against the South Americans. “I like the best
                                players to play, I train with the best and I want the best players to play,” said Muslera. Egypt, a 
                                no-frills side who play on the counterattack under the wily Cuper, face hosts Russia on Tuesday and the
                                Saudis on June 25 in their last group game. </p></div><br/>

                                making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
                                looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through 
                                the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from
                                sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
                                written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
                                first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                                The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 
                                1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact
